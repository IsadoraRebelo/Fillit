## <b> Summary: </b><br>
This is the story of a piece of Tetris, one little square and a dev walk into a bar...

## <b> Introduction: </b><br>
Fillit is a project that let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square. <p>
A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris.

## <b> General Considerations: </b><br>
